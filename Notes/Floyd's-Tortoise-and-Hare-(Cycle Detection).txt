Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins.

First of all, where does the cycle come from? Let's use the function f(x) = nums[x] to construct the sequence: x, nums[x], nums[nums[x]], nums[nums[nums[x]]], ....

Each new element in the sequence is an element in nums at the index of the previous element.

If one starts from x = nums[0], such a sequence will produce a linked list with a cycle.

The cycle appears because nums contains duplicates. The duplicate node is a cycle entrance.

Algorithm::

Floyd's algorithm consists of two phases and uses two pointers, usually called tortoise and hare.

In phase 1, hare = nums[nums[hare]] is twice as fast as tortoise = nums[tortoise]. Since the hare goes fast, it would be the first one who enters the cycle and starts to run around the cycle. At some point, the tortoise enters the cycle as well, and since it's moving slower the hare catches the tortoise up at some intersection point. Now phase 1 is over, and the tortoise has lost.

To compute the intersection point, let's note that the hare has traversed twice as many nodes as the tortoise, i.e. 2d(tortoise)==d(hare), that means

2(F + a) = F + nC + a2(F+a)=F+nC+a, where nn is some integer.

In phase 2, we give the tortoise a second chance by slowing down the hare, so that it now moves with the speed of tortoise: tortoise = nums[tortoise], hare = nums[hare]. The tortoise is back at the starting position, and the hare starts from the intersection point.

Let's show that this time they meet at the cycle entrance after FF steps.

..The tortoise started from zero, so its position after FF steps is FF.

..The hare started at the intersection point F + a = nCF+a=nC, so its position after F steps is nC + FnC+F, that is the same point as FF.

..So the tortoise and the (slowed down) hare will meet at the entrance of the cycle.

Proof::

let F be the length upto starting point of cycle, C be the length of the Cycle.suppose we got some intersection point at a in the loop.
Phase-1::
from
2d(tortoise)==d(rabbit/hare)
2(F+a+t*C) = (F+a+r*c)
there for F+a = (r-2t).
here r,t are the no of cycles that rabbit and tortoise rounded before meeting at intersection point.
Phase-2::
to meet at starting point the tortoise should move by distance F+a+N*c; and rabbit should move the distance C-a+a+N*c; Hence proved....
